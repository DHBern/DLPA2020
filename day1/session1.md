During this session, we will perform a transcription of a couple of pages of a theater play. This means extracting the text out of a digital image.

## Download the image to transcribe

## Use Transkribus to perform the transcription

You need to download and install [Transkribus](https://transkribus.eu). You also need to create an account.

## Inspect the output 

Unless you already have a favourite text and XML editor, we recommend to download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
