In this session, we will experiment with TEI encoding with a focus on drama features.

## Customization of the TEI Schema

In order to facilitate the understanding of the TEI Schema, we will produce a basic TEI customization that reduces the number of tags defined in the Schema.

The customization will be generated with [Roma](https://roma.tei-c.org/startroma.php) and you will have to go through the following steps.

First select "Reduce" as the type of customization.

![TEI reduce](../images/sessions/tei-reduce.png)

Then in the "Module" tab, add or remove the modules in order to keep only `core`, `drama`, `header` and `textstructure`.

![TEI modules](../images/sessions/tei-modules.png)

Finally, generate the Schema from the "Schema" tab selecting "Relax NG schema (XML Syntax)".

![TEI generate](../images/sessions/tei-generate.png)

Save the schema a subdirectory (personal name) of `./tei`

## Text encoding

We will now start to edit a TEI file. Place it in the same directory as the Schema generated above. You can use the TEI output from Transkribus (otherwise there is a `TEI-template.xml` file in `./tei`).

In order to be able to validate the file while editing, we should install the [Scholarly XML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=raffazizzi.sxml) extension and the additional ones recommended by it - see at the bottom of the page.

The TEI file needs to refer to the Schema for validation. This means adding before the root `<TEI>` tag the following instruction - with the appropriate Schema filename:
```xml
<?xml-model href="tei_drama.rng" schematypens="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0" type="application/xml"?>
```

Once this is place, you should be able to validate your file with the palette raised  with `Command-Shift-P` (Mac) or `Ctrl-Shift-P` (Windows) and the "Scholarly XML: Validate XML with associated RELAX NG Schema" command.

![XML validate](../images/sessions/xml-validate.png)

You can now edit the content of the file. Some help:
* [TEI Guidelines / Performance Texts](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DR.html)
* [TEI By Example / Drama](https://teibyexample.org/tutorials/TBED05v00.htm)

You can try to:
* Encode the global structure of the excerpt within the `<body>`

```xml
<div type="act">
    <head>ACT PREMIER</head>
    <div type="scene">
        <head>SCENE PREMIERE</head>
        <!-- ... -->
    </div>
</div>
```
* Markup a speech lines with the speaker and their texts (note the escaped `&` as `&amp;`)

```xml
<sp>
    <speaker>MAISTRE DE MUSIQUE </speaker>
    <p>Venez, entrez dans cette Salle, &amp; vous reposez-l√†, en attendant qu'il vienne</p>
</sp>
```

* Add a cast list in the front matter

```xml
<castItem xml:id="jourdain">
    <role>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN</role>
    <roleDesc>Bourgeois</roleDesc>
</castItem>
```

* Make the speaker refer to items in the cast list

```xml
<sp who="#jourdain">
```

* Add stage directions with the `<stage>` element

## Publication

For the publication, we use [CETEIcean](https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean) that is already loaded in the website structure. To run it, we need a to use another front matter than for the other pages. It needs to be
```md
---
layout: tei
title: Title-of-your-page
teiFile: "your-directory/your-TEI-file.xml"
---

```

Any Markdown code in the file will be displayed before the TEI content.
