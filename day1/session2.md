## Connection to GitHub

For this session, you need to download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - unless you already have another Git client installed or prefer to use the command line. You also need to create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com).

From the GitHub Desktop application, you should be able to login with your GitHub accout

You can then clone the [course repository](https://github.com/dhbern/dlpa2020) into your local machine. 

Try then to create a new branch in which you will be doing some modifcations. 

![GitHub branch]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sessions/github-branch.png)

Once your modifications are done (changing a file, adding a file, etc.) you should then stage and commit then. 

![GitHub commit]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sessions/github-commit.png)

Finally, you can push your commits to the GitHub server with they can be merged to the master branch.
