		         <l>Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!</l>

		         <p>Oh, boys, don't be sentimental; it's bad for the digestion! Take a tonic, follow me!</p>
		         <stage>(Sings, and all follow)</stage>
		         <l>Our captain stood upon the deck,</l>
		         <l>A spy-glass in his hand,</l>
		         <l>A-viewing of those gallant whales</l>
		         <l>That blew at every strand.</l>
		         <l>Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,</l>
		         <l>And by your braces stand,</l>
		         <l>And we'll have one of those fine whales,</l>
		         <l>Hand, boys, over hand!</l>
		         <l>So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!</l>
		         <l>While the bold harpooneer is striking the whale!</l>

		         <p>Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d'ye hear, bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the watch. I've the sort of mouth for that--the hogshead mouth. So, so, <stage>(thrusts his head down the scuttle,)</stage>
		            Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight bells there below! Tumble up!</p>

		      <sp>
		         <speaker>Dutch sailor.</speaker>
		         <p>Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark this in our old Mogul's wine; it's quite as deadening to some as filliping to others. We sing; they sleep--ay, lie down there, like ground-tier butts. At 'em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail 'em through it. Tell 'em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell 'em it's the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment. That's the way--<emph>that</emph>
		            's it; thy throat ain't spoiled with eating Amsterdam butter.</p>

		      <sp>
		         <speaker>French sailor.</speaker>
		         <p>Hist, boys! let's have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand by all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!</p>

		         <speaker>Pip.</speaker>
		         <stage>(Sulky and sleepy.)</stage>
		         <p>Don't know where it is.</p>
		      </sp>
		      <sp>
		         <speaker>French sailor.</speaker>
		         <p>Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I say; merry's the word; hurrah! Damn me, won't you dance? Form, now, Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs! legs!</p>
